            <p>Greetings from Minnesota! I'm Alex, an aspiring software engineer currently enrolled at General
                Assembly.
                My goal is to use the skills I gain here to pivot careers and create new opportunities to pursue
                my
                passions.</p>

            <p>
                In the summer of 2018, I made the life-changing decision to leave behind alcohol and partying ‚Äî and
                suddenly had to figure out what "fun" was supposed to mean (spoiler: it was not just Netflix and Call of
                Duty). I
                found my answer on the golf course ‚Äî my sanctuary and a place that helped me heal physically, mentally,
                and spiritually.
                <br><br>
                The game has given so much to me, and one day I hope to give back by organizing a fundraiser to help
                make golf more accessible for kids in my community.
                <br><br>
                When I am not on the course pretending I am better than I am, you will probably find me headbanging to
                Metalcore, watching the Minnesota Wild with my dad (and questioning our life choices), cuddling my dog
                Gideonüê∂üõèÔ∏è‚ù§Ô∏è, gaming with friendsüéÆ, or managing one of my 25 fantasy football teams ‚Äî yes, 25, because
                apparently I enjoy stress.

            <h4>Career At Ingram Micro</h4>

            <img src="images/Ingram_truck.jpg" alt="Ingram Truck" width="80">

            <p>
                For nearly 11 years, I worked for Ingram Micro in their LifeCycle Operations division. Ingram Micro offers ITAD solutions to customers across the globe, including refurbishment, repair, and remarketing of technology products ‚Äî all while prioritizing physical data security and environmental responsibility.
              </p>
              <br><br>
              <h3>As a Commercial Driver</h3>

                <li>Maintained a perfect safety record, exceeding company standards.</li>
                <li>Coordinated and executed complex customer-focused services across the greater Twin Cities area.</li>
                <li>Built a strong reputation for quality and reliability among colleagues and customers.</li>
                <li>Collaborated with third-party resources to better meet customer expectations.</li>
                <li>Proactively found solutions to save the company money, including carrying out projects that typically require two people.</li>
              </ul>
              
              <p>
                I take extreme pride in the amazing things my team accomplished during my tenure with the company.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                I am forever grateful for the experiences, lessons, and the people that made my time with Ingram Micro so special.
