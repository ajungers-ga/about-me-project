            <p>Greetings from Minnesota! I'm Alex, an aspiring software engineer currently enrolled at General
                Assembly.
                My goal is to use the skills I gain here to pivot careers and create new opportunities to pursue
                my
                passions.</p>

            <h1>My Passions</h1>


            <p>
                In the summer of 2018, I made the life-changing decision to quit drinking ‚Äî and
                suddenly had to rediscover what organic "fun" and "joy" really meant. (<strong>spoiler:</strong> it was
                not
                Netflix and Call of Duty)
                <br><br>
                I found my answer on the golf course ‚Äî my sanctuary and a place that helped me heal mentally and
                spiritually.
                <br><br>
                My time chasing the ball down the fairway and scrambling to save par brought me a sense
                of calm and helped me think & refelct. I realized not only WHAT is important in my life, but WHO is important.<br><br>
                I consider myself incredibly lucky to have the best Dad in the world and supportive friends and family
                that always make me feel loved!
                <br><br>
                'Pay It Forward' is a key value my Dad bestowed upon me and I try to honor that value everyday by giving
                support and love to those I come across (usually in the form of witty humor, but I know I can do more!).
                <br><br>
                The game has given me so much and one day I hope to give back by organizing a fundraiser to
                help
                make golf more accessible for kids in my community. Golf is the ultimate game of 'Life' & the lessons learned on the golf course can be applied to real-life situations. 
                <br><br>
                When I am not on the course pretending to be a single digit handicap, you will probably find me
                headbanging to
                Metalcore, watching the Minnesota Wild with my dad (and questioning our life choices), cuddling my dog
                Gideonüê∂üõèÔ∏è‚ù§Ô∏è, gaming with friendsüéÆ, or managing one of my 25 fantasy football teams ‚Äî yes, 25, because
                apparently I enjoy stress.

            <p>
                For nearly 11 years, I worked for Ingram Micro in their LifeCycle division. Ingram Micro

                technology products ‚Äî all while prioritizing physical data security and environmental responsibility.
                <br><br>Ingram Micro did so many amazing things for me and I am forever grateful for the people who made
                the ride so much fun!
            </p>
