            <p>Greetings from Minnesota! I'm Alex, an aspiring software engineer currently enrolled at General
                Assembly.
                My goal is to use the skills I gain here to pivot careers and create new opportunities to pursue
                my
                passions.</p>

            <h1>My Passions</h1>
           

            <p>
                In the summer of 2018, I made the life-changing decision to quit drinking ‚Äî and
                suddenly had to rediscover what "fun" was supposed to mean to me. (<strong>spoiler:</strong> it was not
                just Netflix and Call of
                Duty)
                <br><br>
                I found my answer on the golf course ‚Äî my sanctuary and a place that helped me heal mentally and
                spiritually.<br><br> My time chasing the ball down the fairway and scrambling to save par brought me a sense
                of calm and reminded me not only of what‚Äôs important in life, but who is important. I consider myself
                incredibly lucky to have such a strong support system around me.
                <br><br> The game has given so much to me, and one day I hope to give back by organizing a fundraiser to
                help
                make golf more accessible for kids in my community.
                <br><br>
                When I am not on the course pretending to be a single digit handicap, you will probably find me headbanging to
                Metalcore, watching the Minnesota Wild with my dad (and questioning our life choices), cuddling my dog
                Gideonüê∂üõèÔ∏è‚ù§Ô∏è, gaming with friendsüéÆ, or managing one of my 25 fantasy football teams ‚Äî yes, 25, because
                apparently I enjoy stress.

            <p>

                technology products ‚Äî all while prioritizing physical data security and environmental responsibility.
                <br><br>Ingram Micro did so many amazing things for me and I am forever grateful for the people who made the ride so fun! 
            </p>
            <br><br>
            <h3>As a Commercial Driver</h3>
            <ul>
