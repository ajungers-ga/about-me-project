                <p>Greetings from Minnesota! I'm Alex, an aspiring software engineer currently enrolled at General
                    Assembly.
                    My goal is to use the skills I gain here to pivot careers and create new opportunities to pursue my
                    passions.</p>

                <h4>My Passions</h4>
                <div class="rotationfeature">
                    <button id="prevbutton">Prev</button>

                </div>
                <p>In the summer of 2018, I decided to leave alcohol and partying in the past. I quickly had to redefine
                    what "fun" meant to me. The golf course became my church â€” helping heal my physical, mental, and
                    spiritual health. I'm inspired to grow the 
                    game and someday I want to organize a fundraiser to make the game more accessible to less fortunate kids
                    in
                    my local community.<br> <br>When I'm not on the Course, I also love headbanging to some Metalcore,
                    watching the Minnesota Wild with my Dad, cuddling my dog - Gideon, gaming with friends, and playing
                    competitive fantasy football across 25 leagues.</p>
