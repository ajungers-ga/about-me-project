# Project 1 - DOM Portfolio (jQuery Refactor)

This project was originally my **very first project** at General Assembly. At the time, I used vanilla JavaScript to create simple DOM interactions like a photo carousel, dark mode toggle, and navigation menu.

Two months later — after diving deep into full-stack development, building CRUD apps, working with APIs, React, Django, SQL, and more — I’ve returned to this project to **refactor the code using jQuery**.

What once felt complex now looks surprisingly simple. Three to Four files with a couple hundred lines of code? I miss these days!!

### What’s New:
- Replaced all `document.getElementById` and `querySelector` calls with jQuery selectors
- Converted event listeners to `.on()` methods
- Used jQuery's `.toggleClass()` and `.attr()` for cleaner interactivity
- Carousel and dark mode now use jQuery-driven logic
- The documentation at www.w3schools.com/jquery/ was used to help me refactor the code.

### Reflection:
This refactor was a great reminder of how far I’ve come in just a few months. It’s wild to look back at this small project and realize how much easier it is to understand and improve today.
